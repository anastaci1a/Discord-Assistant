**WHAT I DID BEFORE THIS COMMIT**
- made/set up everything not mentioned below
- made a ChatHub class in src/lib/openai.js
- realized how stupid/useless my system was in src/controllers/chatController.js if this is gonna be a discord bot
  - sorta gave up
- began working on the discord bot and realized that it's super annoying without ES6 :(

**WHAT I JUST DID THIS COMMIT**
- set up the entire project with ES6 :)
- imported/configured ngrok/localtunnel

**WHAT TO DO NEXT**
- make a simple discord bot for testing
- see if discord works with either ngrok or localtunnel (issues with manual authentication)
  - if that doesn't work, set up tunneling using a service without manual authentication
  - if that *does* work, yay!
- make the damn discord bot
- change the assistant name from 'Lexi' to 'Simone'
